# Edunet_Fake_News_Detection_Using_ML

#Project Overview
The project aims to develop a web-based application using Streamlit that detects fake news articles using machine learning algorithms. The application will take a news article as input and predict whether it's fake or real.

#Dataset
The project uses a labeled dataset of news articles, where each article is labeled as either "fake" or "real". The dataset can be obtained from various sources, such as Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

#Machine Learning Algorithm
The project uses a supervised machine learning algorithm, such as:

1. Logistic Regression: A simple and effective algorithm for binary classification tasks.
2. Decision Trees: A tree-based algorithm that's easy to interpret and visualize.
3. Random Forest: An ensemble algorithm that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful algorithm that's effective for high-dimensional data.
#Feature Extraction
The project uses various feature extraction techniques, such as:

1. Bag-of-Words (BoW): A simple technique that represents text data as a bag of words.
2. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): A technique that takes into account the importance of each word in the document.
3. Word Embeddings: A technique that represents words as vectors in a high-dimensional space.

#Streamlit Application
The project uses Streamlit to develop a web-based application that takes a news article as input and predicts whether it's fake or real. The application consists of:

1. Text Input: A text area where users can input the news article.
2. Predict Button: A button that triggers the prediction algorithm when clicked.
3. Prediction Output: A text area that displays the prediction result.

#Code Implementation
The project uses Python as the programming language and Streamlit as the web framework. The code implementation involves:

1. Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the dataset by tokenizing the text data, removing stop words, and converting the text data into numerical features.
2. Model Training: Training the machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset.
3. Model Deployment: Deploying the trained model using Streamlit.
4. Application Development: Developing the Streamlit application that takes user input and displays the prediction result.
